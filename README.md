At the start of the game, 5 targets are displayed at random locations. The player's task is to score as many points as possible by shooting the targets with the left mouse button within the given 30 seconds. The game algorithm calculates the distance from the center of the target and awards points ranging from 1 to 100. After each shot, a message displaying the points scored or "Perfect shot" comment is shown for 0.4 seconds. The game spawns a new target after each shot. The player can see the time left and their live score at the top of the page. When the time runs out, the final score and some statistics are shown. Then the game can be restarted after 1 second by simply pressing the left mouse button.
